#13 matrices: 7 with percentages and 6 with gene counts

#Three different gene counts:
# DISTINCT  : always count a maximum 1
# SEMI      : Counts gene copies of genome A up to number of copies in genome B.
# EVERYTHING: Count all genes of genome A as long as the other genome has a copy.

#Percentages of genes shared between two genomes. Gene counts are divided either by the sum of one or both genomes
#1 Percentage SEMI gene counts. Derived from #11 & #12
#2 Percentage SEMI gene counts, genome left column. Derived from #11 & #11 diagonal
#3 Percentage DISTINCT gene counts. Derived from #7 & #8
#4 Percentage DISTINCT based on genome in left column. Derived from #7 & #7 diagonal
#5 Percentage informative DISTINCT based on both genomes. Derived from #9 & #10
#6 Percentage EVERYTHING gene counts based on genome in left column. Derived from #13 & #13 diagonal
