#Average number of core, accessory, unique groups gained or lost per additional genome based on 10000 pangenome size iterations.
#The AVERAGE, MEDIAN gain/loss, and STANDARD DEVIATION are shown for each gene category between two pangenome sizes

Number of groups of first (N=3) and last (N=13) size -> Average number of genes gained/lost per additional genome
